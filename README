Here we provide a testing application and scripts that can be used
to exercise the SO_TXTIME APIs, the etf qdisc and the taprio qdisc.

The example is based on a sample application (udp_tai.c) provided by
Richard Cochran as part of the RFC v1 of SO_TXTIME. We've extended
it in several ways so it may be used as an example of different
setups: per-packet Tx time only based systems, per-port Time-aware
scheduler, and a combination of those.

The documentation is split into 2 README files:

 - README.etf: Provides instructions for how to setup an example to
               use etf standalone. In other words, only Time-based
               transmission is used.

 - README.taprio: Provides instructions for how to setup an example
                  to use etf and taprio together. That means using
                  a Time-aware scheduler (i.e. 802.1Qbv) in conjunction
                  time-based transmission for fine-grained control over
                  the Tx time of packets.

A custom tool known as 'dump-classifier' was developed so we can
verify if a taprio schedule is being respected. For more information
please check README.classifier .
